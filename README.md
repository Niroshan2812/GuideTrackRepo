# GuideTrack ðŸ“˜  
*A mobile app to create, manage, and follow step-by-step guides with multimedia support.*

## ðŸ§  Overview

**GuideTrack** is a React Native mobile application that helps users create detailed, categorized, and multimedia-supported guides. It allows you to define a guide title, description, and category, and then add multiple structured stepsâ€”each with a task, hint, image, and audio recording. Ideal for tutorials, DIY processes, technical workflows, or training content.

All data is stored locally using SQLite, making it fully functional offline.
